\abstract*{
In situ coupling poses a unique set of challenges to the design of analysis and
visualization infrastructures.
%
When running with a simulation, resources, such as time and memory are constrained.
%
As simulation applications port to accelerator-based HPC architectures, so
must our analysis tools.
%
Further, integrating into a simulation's build system adds additional complexity
becomes difficult with more dependencies.
%
Our current community tools were not designed with these set of issues in mind.
%
Ascent is an emerging is situ analysis and visualization infrastructure that
addresses these challenges.
%
From Ascent's inception, we have targeted in situ use cases and many-core
architectures.
%
In this paper, we will discuss in detail Ascent's design considerations, data and control interfaces, system architecture, and success stories.

This chapter describes the Ascent library for in situ visualization
and analysis.
%
Ascent was designed to deliver on two goals which are often in tension:
 (1) minimize encumbrance on simulation codes that incorporate Ascent,
i.e., a ``flyweight'' design, and 
(2) deliver maximum capability, especially for modern supercomputers,
%
In addition, Ascent built for production use --- it has documentation, 
examples, engages in modern software engineering practices, etc.

In terms of flyweight design, Ascent aims to minimize 
execution time, memory usage, binary size, and code integrations.
%
The first two, execution time and memory usage, benefit from directly
incorporating VTK-m~\cite{VTK-m} into Ascent.  
%
VTK-m's data model supports many array layouts (e.g., row major versus 
column major, array of structures versus structures of arrays) 
in a zero-copy manner.
%
Further, VTK-m provides native support for many-core architectures,
including Nvidia GPUs, various Intel architectures, 
and planned support for AMD GPUs.
%
As a result, Ascent is able to perform its algorithms very quickly,
since it can make full use of the underlying hardware architecture.
%
Statement about binary size.
%
Statement about code integrations that references API section.

Statement about capabilities.  Emphasis on being an integrator.
This is where Jupyter, triggers, etc. get mentioned.  Also emphasize
exascale.
Ascent has a rich feature set and integrates with other ecosystems.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Supports common visualization operations such as slicing and dicing your data.
  \item Supports ray traced surface and volume rendering as well as simulated radiography.
  \item Supports Queries for getting quantitative answers to questions
  \item Supports Triggers for adaptive visualization and analysis
  \item Outputs images sequences and Cinema image databases
  \item Outputs extracts for exporting data to HDF5, ADIOS, Python and Jupyter
  \item Support interactive visualization and analysis with Jupyter and Catalyst
  \item Supports C/C++, Python and Fortran language bindings
\end{itemize}

Statement about Devil Ray, but a forward reference a section in success stories --- success as an integrator.
