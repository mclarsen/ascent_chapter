\abstract*{
In situ coupling poses a unique set of challenges to the design of analysis and
visualization infrastructures.
%
When running with a simulation, resources, such as time and memory are constrained.
%
As simulation applications port to accelerator-based HPC architectures, so
must our analysis tools.
%
Further, integrating into a simulation's build system adds additional complexity
becomes difficult with more dependencies.
%
Our current community tools were not designed with these set of issues in mind.
%
Ascent is an emerging is situ analysis and visualization infrastructure that
addresses these challenges.
%
From Ascent's inception, we have targeted in situ use cases and many-core
architectures.
%
In this paper, we will discuss in detail Ascent's design considerations, data and control interfaces, system architecture, and success stories.
