Software complexity. Ascent is less complex.

\subsection{Target exascale architectures: maximize constrained resources}
Ascent's primary in situ use case is tightly-coupled, i.e.,
Ascent shares the same computational resources (proximity) and
memory space as the simulaiton (access).
%
All core functionality in Ascent, transforming data
and making pictures, executes on the same hardware as the
simulation through portably performance abstractions such as
VTK-m and RAJA.
%
This enables Ascent to minimize data movement by directly accessing
the simulation data memory without making copies of the data.
%

Memory and time are both constrained resources in situ.

%
Simulations often consume almost all availble system memory,
leaving only a small fraction to in situ infrastructures.
%
It is imperative that Ascent uses memory as efficiently as possible
as not to exceed system memory.
%
To that end, Ascent can directly access simulation memory, whether it be
on the CPU or GPU.
%
While important, direct simulation memory access is only half
the battle of memory efficiency.
%
Visualization pipelines transforms data(e.g., isocontours) from
one form to another, and efficiently managing the memory consumed
by intermediate results is equally important.
%
\fix{possible example: contour of turbulence simulation on
structured grid can create a dataset larger than the original.}
%
In Ascent, we free memory used by intermediate results as soon
as they are not needed by downstream transforms.
%


%
Supercomper architectures have significanlty changed since
%
Current community visualization tools, such as ParaView and VisIt, were originally
designed to execute using one MPI rank per CPU core.
%

All core functionality(i.e., transforming data and making pictures) in
Ascent targets exascale architectures.
