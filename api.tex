This section describes the API for Ascent.
%
It begins, in \S\ref{Conduit}, by describing Conduit, which is the underlying
interface for passing information to Ascent.
%
Ascent then has two main APIs, both of which are built on top of Conduit.
%
%
The first API, described in \S\ref{Blueprint}, is the ``data interface,'' i.e., how
to pass simulation data to Ascent.
%
This API exists outside Ascent, and has its own product name --- Blueprint.
%
The second API, described in \S\ref{ascent_control}, is the ``control interface,''
i.e., how to instruct Ascent to carry out the actions from \S\ref{sec:capabilities}.
%
Finally, \S\ref{api_summary} discusses typical experiences for integrating with Ascent.
