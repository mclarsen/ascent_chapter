Consistent with its flyweight approach, the typical experience integrating Ascent involves a
relatively short amount of time and small amount of code.
%
While specifics vary based on the complexity of the simulation code and the
amount of things to integrate, a typical integration would involve
50 to 100 lines of code.
%
Build issues tend to be manageable, since the amount of API exposed to a simulation code
is small, and since there is strong CMake support.  
%
(Native Makefile options are also available.)
%
If a single individual had expertise in both Ascent and a simulation code, then
an integration can be done in a few hours or less.
%
Of course, the more typical situation is that an individual has expertise in either
Ascent or the simulation code. 
%
In this case, additional time is needed to learn the other technology,
increasing overall integration time.
%
Finally, reiterating discussion from \S\ref{ascent_control}, most integrations
are smaller since they focus on only passing data, and leave the work for specifying
Ascent controls to YAML files that can be specified at run-time.
