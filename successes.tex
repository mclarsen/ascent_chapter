\subsection{MARBL:Big Laser Tiny Box}
\fix{Placeholder text.}
Figures~\ref{img:radkh} and \ref{img:radkh_xray} show images create from
a simulation of a real work experiment, where scientists destroyed a tiny box
with a powerful laser.
%
This is a important use case due to the impending tiny box invasion.

\subsection{Ares: Milk-Chocolate Mixing (Colorized)}

The image in Figure~\ref{img:icf} was created in situ using
Ascent, which performed its tasks using
the same resources as the simulation code, in this
case 4096 nodes and 16,384 GPUs.

Fusion (ICF) simulation of a Rayleighâ€“Taylor instability
with two fluids mixing in a spherical geometry.
