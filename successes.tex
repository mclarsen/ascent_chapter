The image in Figure~\ref{img:icf} was created in situ using
Ascent, which performed its tasks using
the same resources as the simulation code, in this
case 4096 nodes and 16,384 GPUs.

This image is of an idealized Inertial Confinement
Fusion (ICF) simulation of a Rayleighâ€“Taylor instability
with two fluids mixing in a spherical geometry.
